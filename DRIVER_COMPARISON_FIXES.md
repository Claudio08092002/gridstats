# Driver Comparison Fixes - 2021 Season

## Issues Fixed

### 1. NaN Driver appearing in 2021 season
**Problem:** A driver with code "NaN" or invalid codes were showing up in the driver list

**Solution:** Added validation to filter out invalid driver codes at multiple stages:
- When processing race results (line ~376)
- When building the final driver payload (line ~432)

**Changes in `backend/app/routers/compare.py`:**

```python
# Filter invalid codes during processing
if code in ['NAN', 'NONE', ''] or code.lower() == 'nan':
    continue

# Filter invalid full names
if not entry["full_name"] or entry["full_name"] in ['nan', 'NaN', 'None']:
    continue
```

### 2. Drivers not sorted alphabetically by first name
**Problem:** Drivers were returned in random order (by driver code)

**Solution:** Added sorting by first name before returning the payload

**Changes in `backend/app/routers/compare.py`:**

```python
# Sort drivers alphabetically by first name
sorted_drivers = dict(sorted(
    drivers_payload.items(),
    key=lambda item: item[1]["full_name"].split()[0] if item[1]["full_name"] else item[0]
))

return {
    "schema_version": SCHEMA_VERSION,
    "season": year,
    "drivers": sorted_drivers,  # Now sorted!
    "sprint_rounds": sorted(sprint_rounds),
}
```

## Testing

1. Delete the cached 2021 season file:
```powershell
Remove-Item backend\app\season_cache\season_2021.json
```

2. Restart the backend:
```powershell
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

3. Test the endpoint:
```powershell
curl http://localhost:8000/api/f1/compare/season/2021
```

4. Verify:
   - ✅ No "NaN" driver in the list
   - ✅ Drivers sorted alphabetically (Antonio, Carlos, Charles, Daniel, ...)
   - ✅ All valid drivers present

## Expected Driver Order (2021)

After the fix, the 2021 season drivers should appear in this order:
1. **A**ntonio Giovinazzi
2. **C**arlos Sainz
3. **C**harles Leclerc
4. **D**aniel Ricciardo
5. **E**steban Ocon
6. **F**ernando Alonso
7. **G**eorge Russell
8. **K**imi Räikkönen
9. **L**ance Stroll
10. **L**ando Norris
11. **L**ewis Hamilton
12. **M**ax Verstappen
13. **M**ick Schumacher
14. **N**icholas Latifi
15. **N**ikita Mazepin
16. **P**ierre Gasly
17. **S**ebastian Vettel
18. **S**ergio Pérez
19. **V**altteri Bottas
20. **Y**uki Tsunoda

(Plus any reserve/replacement drivers)

## Files Modified

- ✅ `backend/app/routers/compare.py` - Added NaN filtering and alphabetical sorting
- ✅ Deleted `backend/app/season_cache/season_2021.json` - Forces regeneration with fixes

## Deployment

The changes are backward compatible. When you deploy:

1. The backend will automatically filter out NaN drivers
2. All season endpoints will return drivers sorted alphabetically
3. Existing cached files will work but might still have NaN until refreshed
4. To refresh all seasons, delete all `season_*.json` files or use `?refresh=true`

## For Frontend

No frontend changes needed! The API now returns:
- Clean driver list (no NaN)
- Alphabetically sorted by first name
- Same data structure as before

The driver comparison component will automatically display drivers in the correct order.
