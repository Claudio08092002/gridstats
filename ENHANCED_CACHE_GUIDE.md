# Enhanced Cache System - Complete Solution

## What Changed

### Backend Changes (`backend/app/routers/track.py`)

1. **Enhanced `_sanitize_map_payload` function** (line ~347)
   - Added `include_metadata` parameter
   - Now saves `winners`, `winner`, `layout_variants`, and `layout_years` when `include_metadata=True`

2. **Enhanced warmup endpoint** (line ~1032)
   - Added `?enhanced=true` query parameter
   - When `enhanced=true`, it populates cache with:
     - ✅ Track coordinates and corners
     - ✅ Winners list (recent race winners)
     - ✅ Layout variants (different track configurations)
     - ✅ Layout years (years for each configuration)
     - ✅ Track length and metadata

### Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/app/components/track/track.ts`)

1. **Updated cache loading** (line ~298-330)
   - Now reads `winners`, `layout_variants`, and `layout_years` from bundled cache files
   - Displays all metadata without making HTTP requests

## How to Use

### Step 1: Run Enhanced Warmup

Start your backend locally:
```powershell
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open in browser:
```
http://localhost:8000/api/f1/tracks/warmup?enhanced=true
```

**What happens:**
- Loads all track maps from FastF1
- Collects winners from season_cache files
- Calculates layout variants by analyzing all years
- Saves everything to cache files with full metadata
- Takes 10-20 minutes (fetches data for ~250 race events)

### Step 2: Copy Enhanced Cache to Frontend

```powershell
.\copy-cache-to-frontend.ps1
```

This copies the enhanced cache files from `backend/app/tracks_cache/` to `frontend/public/assets/tracks_cache/`.

### Step 3: Deploy

```powershell
# Commit changes
git add frontend/public/assets/tracks_cache/
git add backend/app/routers/track.py
git add frontend/src/app/components/track/track.ts
git commit -m "Add enhanced offline cache with winners and layouts"

# Rebuild Docker images
docker-compose build

# Push to Docker Hub
docker push claudio08092002/gridstats-backend:latest
docker push claudio08092002/gridstats-frontend:latest
```

### Step 4: Redeploy in Portainer

Update your stack to pull the new images. The app will now work **completely offline** with all features:
- ✅ Track maps with corners
- ✅ Recent winners list
- ✅ Layout variants selector
- ✅ Layout years
- ✅ Track length

## What's Included in Enhanced Cache

Each cache file (`trackmap_*.json`) now has this structure:

```json
{
  "_cache_version": 4,
  "track_key": "monaco_grand_prix",
  "entries": {
    "2024-8": {
      "track": [...],
      "corners": [...],
      "layout_length": 3.337,
      "layout_label": "Monaco Circuit",
      "layout_signature": "sig_xyz",
      "circuit_name": "Circuit de Monaco",
      "year": 2024,
      "round": 8,
      "winners": [
        {
          "year": 2024,
          "round": 8,
          "driver": "Charles Leclerc",
          "team": "Ferrari",
          "code": "LEC"
        },
        ...
      ],
      "winner": {
        "year": 2024,
        "round": 8,
        "driver": "Charles Leclerc",
        "team": "Ferrari"
      },
      "layout_variants": [
        {
          "layout_signature": "sig_xyz",
          "layout_label": "Monaco Circuit",
          "layout_length": 3.337,
          "years": [2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024],
          "rounds": [
            {"year": 2018, "round": 6},
            {"year": 2019, "round": 6},
            ...
          ]
        }
      ],
      "layout_years": [2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024]
    }
  }
}
```

## Why Abu Dhabi and French GP Were Failing

These tracks likely have incomplete cache files (missing certain years) or FastF1 API issues. The enhanced warmup should fix this by:
1. Loading all available years
2. Handling errors gracefully (skips failed events)
3. Collecting layout variants from ALL cached events

## Verification

After deploying, check these endpoints:

**Cache Status:**
```
http://localhost:8000/api/f1/tracks/cache-status
```

Shows which tracks have cache files and how many events are cached.

**Health Check:**
```
http://localhost:8000/api/healthz
```

Shows cache directory paths and file counts.

## Troubleshooting

### "Recent winners not showing"
- Make sure you ran warmup with `?enhanced=true`
- Check cache files have `winners` field: open `backend/app/tracks_cache/trackmap_*.json`
- Run `copy-cache-to-frontend.ps1` to copy enhanced files

### "Layout selector not appearing"
- Enhanced warmup must analyze multiple years to detect variants
- Some tracks only have one layout (no selector needed)
- Check `layout_variants` field in cache file

### "Still making HTTP requests"
- Clear browser localStorage: DevTools → Application → Local Storage → Clear
- Verify files exist: `frontend/public/assets/tracks_cache/trackmap_*.json`
- Check browser Network tab - should only see `trackmap_*.json` file requests, not `/api/f1/trackmap/...`

## Performance

- **Enhanced warmup:** 10-20 minutes (one-time)
- **Cache file size:** ~5-10MB total (all tracks)
- **Frontend loading:** <100ms (instant from bundled files)
- **No HTTP requests:** Works completely offline
